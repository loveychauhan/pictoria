# Pictoria 🎨

Pictoria is a mordern image-sharing web app. Users can sign up, log in, and upload their favorite pictures. The app displays the images in a clean, responsive grid layout. I built this to practice React and get more comfortable with Firebase and Cloudinary.

## 💡 Why I Built It

I wanted to build something more realistic than to-do lists and calculators — something visual and fun. This project helped me learn how to connect Firebase authentication with real-time image uploads, and how to work with external services like Cloudinary.
